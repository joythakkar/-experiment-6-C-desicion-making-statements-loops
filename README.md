# -experiment-6-C-desicion-making-statements-loops

AIM:

    To study and implement C decision making statements Loops
            

SOFTWARE USED:

              VS Code


OBJECTIVE:

              1.Flow control
              2.Conditional logic
              3.Looping techniques
              4.Code efficiency
              5.Problem solving


THEORY:

         -  Decision-making is the process to make a decision about which part of the code should be executed or not based on some condition. 
        -   Decision-making in C++ involves the usage of conditional statements (also called decision control statements) to execute specific blocks of code primarily based on given situations and their results.

   TYPES OF DESICION MAKING STATEMENTS:
                
        1.if Statement
        2.if-else Statement
        3.if else if Ladder
        4.Nested if else
        5.Switch Statement


SAMPLE OUTPUT: 

    Print even values between 0 and 10:

                                       0 2 4 6 8 10

     Use a for loop to print “SIT" 5 times:

                                      SIT
                                      SIT
                                      SIT
                                      SIT
                                      SIT
